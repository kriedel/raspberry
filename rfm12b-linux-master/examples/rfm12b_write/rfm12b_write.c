/*
   DOCUMENTATION:
   
   This is a simple example that will open the rfm12b device and
   continously send packets over it, then sleeping for a bit. All
   bytes written to the device in a single write() operation will be
   sent by the driver as one cohesive packet.
   
   The driver implements write() pretty much in the way you would
   expect: Usually, a call to write() will not block, unless you
   write a lot of data quickly and fill up the internal send buffer.
   Typically, data is put onto the air in quite a timely fashion, so
   this shouldn't be anything to worry about. However, note that all
   bytes you write in a single call to write() will be sent out in
   a single data packet.
   
   Press Ctrl+C (e.g. send a SIGINT) to quit the program. It will
   then print the driver statistics.
   
   You can use this program in conjunction with the rfm12b_read.c
   test or with the rfm12b_recv Arduino example. It may also be
   useful to test your own receiver code.
