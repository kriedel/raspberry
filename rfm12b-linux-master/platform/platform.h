   It probably doesn't make as much sense now anymore as it did when I
   started to structure the code like this, but originally, I also supported
   a rare x86-compatible board called "Bifferboard", which required a massive
   hack to have an IRQ-usable pin (hijacking a serial-related IRQ) and some
   tricks for fast bit-banging SPI, so it was completely different from a
   "normal" SPI-master driver. Hence the extra abstraction...
