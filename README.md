=========

In my project I connect a digital picture frame (DPF with hacked firmware) to one USB connector and display the picture from the camera module with local time, date and weather information getting from an RSS weather feed. Every 30 seconds a serially numbered picture is saved with the same information in it. Every 200 pictures I generate a timelapse video from the photos with avconv. But this is not all, you can also watch the last picture and if you wish the last video in a webbrowser from everywhere.
